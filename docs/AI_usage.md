I think I used AI effectively. I had not used it for writing code till now, but when I laid out the structure it implemented it the way I wanted to. Bug free for now, but only because it was a pretty small task. More like plumbing. Of course I went through the code it generated to check for errors, and I understood what it wrote out.

I only wish to use AI as a tool and not a crutch. I want to do the thinking myself.

If I dont do the thinking, is it even my project?
