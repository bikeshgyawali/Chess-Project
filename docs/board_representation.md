So i looked at some ways to represent the board for chess. They were : 2d vector, bit board and 1D array. The bit board seems to be done for optimization which is not the goal of the project. 2D vector seems the easiest to work with so I will be choosing that.

It seems it is pretty hard to map the pieces onto a board without the classes themselves first. So I will implement that first.
