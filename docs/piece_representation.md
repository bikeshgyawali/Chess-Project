I think representing the pieces by inheriting the color class is going to make things easier for me.
It turns out I had to create the super() function to send back the info to Pieces class.
Now when a user intializes a piece using a named piece constructor (like Bishop()), both a piece and bishop class are created! I dont see how that would be useful for now though.
