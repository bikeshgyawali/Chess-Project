Just starting the project, for today my main goal would be to just have a board in place. My short term goal is to have a chess board working. Structure it in a way that Player 1 moves, switches to Player 2. And then for the long term have the choice to play against an engine. 

Okay, so by now I have a board with pieces in place. A game loop that tracks move names. I feel like the hard part is done, I think i just need a way to find out if a move is legal or not.
